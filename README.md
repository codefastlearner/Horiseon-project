# Horiseon-project

One of the first projects in which I didn't build any code but instead went and restructured and used semantic elements for accessibility and optimisation.
It was a great challenge to build my skills for structuring and reformatting a page. Also, Iâ€™ve learned about the importance of accessibility.

## Notes and Guide.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

-This is my first project of this kind, on-the-job-ticket, adding and removing features on demand. I was excited to go through the code and have to reformat it in order to meet the accessibility criteria.This is one of the first projects, I successfuly removed all the non-sematic tags in the HMTL file and added semantic tags, also I updated the Css fille in order to comply with the restructed code.

- In this project we introduce the on-the-job ticket assignment, using GitHub to deploy our work and of course, getting familiar with semantic HTML and the use of these tags.
  -The project helps screen readers to better go through the content and also helps SEO engines to find information better.
  -There is a lot to learn ahead, but this is a good introduction to the importance of having a well-structured code .
